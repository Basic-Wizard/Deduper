Define the problem:
During PCR, some DNA fragments may wind up being sequenced more than once if there aren't many 
unique DNA template molecules in the initial library or if the library preparation 
process reduces the number of distinct DNA fragments. When a fragment is sequenced more than once, it creates a duplicate which holds redundant
information. This creates a problem because duplicates can cause over-representation of a sequence. 

Define the solution:
To solve this problem, we will perform deduplication on our SAM file after alignment. We want to dedupe after aligning to a reference genome because
reads with identical sequences that match to the same genomic locations on the reference sequence represent duplicates. We know we have a duplicate when reads
share the same chromosome, same starting position, same UMI (unique molecular identifier), and are on the same strand.
